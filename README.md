# DataCleaning
This repo contains R code to clean accelerometer data obtained from smartphones. 
Data was downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
and contains several files, not all of which were used for this assignment. 

A description of the project out of the University of California-Irvine can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).


Additional files in the repo are the code book, the .R file used to execute the analysis, and the output from the analysis:
  
 + CodeBook.md
  
 + run_analysis.R
  
 + TidyData.csv
  
You can replicate TidyData.csv by downloading the data linked above and executing the commented R code.  You will need to change setwd() to reflect your own working directory.
